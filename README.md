# Arm SoC cpu features table

## What and why?

Arm SoC contains some cpu cores and many other blocks. Processors support some
set of Arm architecture features. And this table is an attempt to show which
cpus have which features.


## How to help?

Check table and submit data from your Arm systems. I need:

- system name ("Pine64 RockPro64")
- SoC name ("Rockchip RK3399")
- /proc/cpuinfo file


## Where to see?

I keep copy at https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/download/tables/arm-socs.html page.
